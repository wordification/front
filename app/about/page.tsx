      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Who made Wordification?</h3>
      <p> Wordification is a web game designed to teach English spelling skills using linguistic principles and applying properties of words in a way not fully used previously by other computer-based teaching applications. </p>

      <p> Our goal is to improve students' overall literacy and contribute to their educational progress, by creating an effective and individualized method for teaching English spelling.</p>

      <p> Wordification is developed by a team of researchers at the University of South Carolina, mentored by Dr. Stanley Dubinsky! </p>
